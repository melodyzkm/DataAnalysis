Bitcoin,Tell that to 2009 Bitcoiners. The general public mocked Bitcoin for years and only changed tune recently.
Bitcoin,5/ Soft forks are marketed as better because they are less likely to lead to a currency split. @VitalikButerin  makes an excellent argument for why soft forks are coercive: "hard forks are opt-in， whereas soft forks allow users no “opting” at all."         https:// vitalik.ca/general/2017/0 3/14/forks_and_markets.html   …
Bitcoin,4/ Bitcoin hard forked multiple times over the years， but it wasn't until the August 1st， 2017 hard fork that a currency split happened. One such earlier fork happened in 2013: https:// bitcoinmagazine.com/articles/bitco in-network-shaken-by-blockchain-fork-1363144448/   …
Bitcoin,3/ A hard fork should not be mistaken for free money or "airdrop coins." There is no community contention over the May 15th hard fork of BCH， so it is unlikely to result in two divergent currencies.
Bitcoin,2/ If a community is divided over some controversial issue being introduced in the fork， the fork can result in a currency split， where two new coins are born from the old one.
Bitcoin,There's a lot of confusion about what a hard fork is. A hard fork is an upgrade mechanism where everyone adopts an expanded ruleset at a specified time. Many coins use scheduled hard forks to upgrade their networks.

Bitcoin,Just keep them on your hardware wallet. You don't need to do anything special. Average users (those who don't run nodes， miners， or businesses) will not notice anything different.
Bitcoin,Mining machines don't need hard drives. #LearnToBitcoin
Bitcoin,100，000 blocks is two years of network operation. 3.2TB of data every two years is perfectly manageable.
Bitcoin,Why would anyone want a 1TB hard drive if they're currently only storing a few GB of data? Having room to grow is a good thing.
Bitcoin,You're right. I meant to write THREE orders of magnitude greater          $2 @tipprbot
Bitcoin,This is a software repository called BUcash.
Bitcoin,In 7 days， Bitcoin Cash will upgrade to allow for 32MB blocks， leaving plenty of room for low-fee transactions and unbounded innovation.        When the 1MB block size limit was introduced in 2010， it was two orders of magnitude (1000x) greater than the actual usage of the network. pic.twitter.com/v4X0JLMjXj

Bitcoin,Merchant adoption can't happen if it's not useful as a currency， and it won't happen if people don't treat it like money and actually spend it at places that accept it.
Bitcoin,No one is saying Bitcoin Cash is BTC. The ticker symbol for Bitcoin Cash is BCH.
Bitcoin,It follows the original design of Bitcoin as described in Satoshi Nakamoto's whitepaper. How is it a lie?

Bitcoin,I think it's more likely that transactions dropped off as BTC became unusable in commerce and merchants started removing support for BTC payments.        The only use case left over is speculation.
Bitcoin,A lot of people keep showing their lack of understanding when they can't tell the difference between bcash， a full node implementation， and Bitcoin Cash， a currency network. https:// github.com/bcoin-org/bcash  
Bitcoin,In the long run， does it matter which is *currently* being transacted more? PayPal has more transactions than BTC， does that make PayPal better?        Which one has superior qualities as a form of money?
Bitcoin,Why are you lying? Median BTC fee is still 5，000% higher than median BCH fee. pic.twitter.com/qH4jA80WT4
Bitcoin,BCH， for one， but all non-BTC coins have seen an explosion in usage and market share.

Bitcoin,BTC fees are 3，900% higher than BCH fees. pic.twitter.com/MZuGVvMEH0
Bitcoin,Hasn't the narrative for the past week been that BTC fees are lower than BCH (priced in sats) and that 1 sat/b is all that is necessary? Are you saying all those people were deceived by the BTC community?
Bitcoin,Wow， the Bitcoin Core network really is unstable! Good thing Bitcoin Cash is always reliable. The one spike on the chart was when Core trolls tried spamming the network， but BCH's beefy 8MB blocks worked through that quickly and fees rose from $0.003 to only $0.006 pic.twitter.com/s0RhByAGRa
